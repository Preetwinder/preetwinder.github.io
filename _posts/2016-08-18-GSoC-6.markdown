Hello,  
This post continues my updates for my work on porting frontera to python2/3 dual support.  
This will be my final post. I have achieved my goal satisfactorily, frontera now works under both Python 2 and Python 3 for all the different scenarios such as with different DB's(Postgres, Mysql, Hbase) and with different Messagebus implementations(Kafka, ZMQ). The latest release of Frontera - [0.6.0](https://github.com/scrapinghub/frontera/releases/tag/v0.6.0) now available on PyPI contains these changes.        
                              
I have also substantially increased the test coverage, now almost all the major components(Workers, Backends, Manager etc) are tested.                                                  
Here is a [link to all of my commits](https://github.com/scrapinghub/frontera/commits?author=Preetwinder)                     
                       
This period of 3 months has been invaluable to me, and I have learned a lot during it. I am greatly thanful to my mentors Alexander Sibiryakov and Paul Tremberth for working with me and helping me through this period.
I would also like to thank my sub-organization Scrapinghub and my organization Python Software Foundation for selecting me. Finally I would like to thank Google for providing this opportunity to me and others.
