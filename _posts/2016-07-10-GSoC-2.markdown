Hello,  
This post continues my updates for my work on porting frontera to python2/3 dual support.  
During the past few days my activity was decreased because I had taken a small break. Before the mid term I had completed my work on
porting single process mode. I haven't yet submitted some of the PR's, I'll do that when my pending PR's is merged. During the
past few days I have begun work on tests for distributed mode components. I will be writing tests for frontera workers, hbase backend, kafka message bus, and
some other components. I have begun work on strategy and db worker tests, and will submit the code in the next few days.   
My work is going as expected and at a decent pace.
