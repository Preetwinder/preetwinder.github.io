Hello,  
This post continues my updates for my work on porting frontera to python2/3 dual support.  
Only 3 days remain till the beginning of the final clean-up period. The testing work is entirely finished, although there are some
other modules I might add tests for later. The porting work is also almost done. I have a PR which ports the final components(workers, middlewares) which will most probably be merged on Monday.
The only remaining modules after that are the messagebus modules. I'll be making a PR with these components on Monday, and it should be merged in the next day or two.
I plan to spend the next week on making changes to the documentation, and performing tests for various deployment configurations to weed out any problems that might have persisted.
If things go according to plan, We should be able to make a release with Python 3 support soon after the work period ends(23 August).
