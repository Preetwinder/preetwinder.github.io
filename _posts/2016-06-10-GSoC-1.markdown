Hello,  
This post continues my updates for my work on porting frontera to python2/3 dual support.  
It has been almost 3 weeks since the beginning of the Google Summer of Code program. During the first 2 weeks, I worked on improving the test coverage of some of the frontera components.
For the 3rd and 4th week I will be working on the actual porting part for single process mode. I have already began work on this, making the intial changes to the code, and better specifying the data model, in terms 
of the string type(unicode or bytes) used. There are also some pending dicisions to be made, like whether to use six or future. I will be dicussing these with my mentors soon. I still have some testing part left, which I'll probably finish in the next few days. 
Things are going well. My co-mentor Alexander Sibiryakov has been very helpful, in advising me, and reviewing my code.
